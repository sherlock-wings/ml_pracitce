# What is this repo?

This is a simple repository covering my efforts to get started with machine learning.

I really should have gotten started with this earlier but ¯\\_( ツ )_/¯

This project organizes the code according to which online tutorials I am following.  The online tutorial behind each subdirectory in this project is linked below

- ml_practice/tutorials/TechWithTim/* -> [Tech with Tim](https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/machine-learning-python/introduction). 


The contents of the ml_practice/data/* directory come from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).
