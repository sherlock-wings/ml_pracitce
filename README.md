# What is this repo?

This is a simple repository covering my efforts to get started with machine learning.

I really should have gotten started with this earlier but ¯\_( ツ )_/¯

The following subdirectories are simple follow-alongs from a free tutorial provided by 
[Tech with Tim](https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/machine-learning-python/introduction). 

- ml_practice/KNN/
- ml_practice/linReg/

All data in these tutorials is taken from the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/).
